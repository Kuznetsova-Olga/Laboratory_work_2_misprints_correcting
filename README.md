This repository contains only two files with the main code for the project. The full version of the project, including dependencies, assets, and launch scripts, is located in the main course repository.  
**To run the project:**  
1.Clone the main course repository:  
`git clone https://github.com/fipl-hse/2025-2-level-labs`  
2.Enter the cloned directory:  
`cd 2025-2-level-labs`  
3.Navigate to the laboratory work #2:  
`cd lab_2_spellcheck`  
4.Replace the files in the corresponding laboratory work with the files from this repository.  
5.Run the program to verify that it works correctly and to see the results.  

**Laboratory work description**    
This work involves the implementation of several string distance metrics, which are a key component of the spell checker system.  
The main task was to identify a word containing a possible typo and suggest a suitable replacement. Proximity is determined by calculating the distance between strings.
Four algorithms were implemented:  
1) distance based on the Jaccard similarity coefficient  
2) distance based on frequency  
3) Levenshtein distance  
4) Jaro-Winkler distance  

**The Levenshtein distance** is a metric that measures the similarity between two strings of characters by calculating the minimum number of single-character elementary operations, such as insertion, deletion, and replacement, required to transform one string into another.
